# bforb
You provide the bed the guest provides the breakfast. An airBnB experience that makes traveling an experience of a life time. 

bforb is an application where users can sign up to provide either a bed or breakfast.  If you provide a bed a guest who stays with you will then provide the breakfast.  Guests and Hosts can share experiences, cultures, talents, entertainment, and life!

### Motivation
This app is built to fulfill requirements for General Assembly SEI Project 3.
